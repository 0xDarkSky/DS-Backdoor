# DS-Backdoor

Backdoor written in Python with a simple GUI. 

I highly recommend looking into the code, so you can understand the concept.

# Install

`pip install pysimplegui`

# Run

`python main.py`

# TO-DO

Add more functions, options. The current version is pretty simple, I'm looking forward to update it.
